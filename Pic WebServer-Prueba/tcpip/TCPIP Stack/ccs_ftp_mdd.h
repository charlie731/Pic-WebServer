/*
   Original code was based off of Microchip's FTP server, but theirs was
   meant for uploading an MPFS image.
   
   This version has been modified by CCS to read/write files from an MDD
   filesystem.
   
   TCP data socket (TCP_PURPOSE_FTP_DATA) needs at least 128 TX and 128 RX 
      bytes allocated (see MAX_FTP_CMD_STRING_LEN)
   
   TCP command socket (TCP_PURPOSE_FTP_COMMAND) needs at least 128 TX and
      128 RX bytes allocated (see MAX_FTP_CMD_STRING_LEN)
   
   
   LIMITATIONS
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
   This FTP server only supports active connections.  If your FTP client has a
   configuration to choose between active or passive connections, choose 
   active connection.
   
   This FTP server only supports 1 simultaneous connection.  Some FTP clients
   will try to use multiple connections for a data transfer.  If your FTP
   client has a configuration for simultenous connections, turn it off or
   set it to 1.  (FileZilla by default will attempt to use multiple
   connections, so for FileZilla you will have to make the change).
   
   
   CALLBACKS/CONFIG MACROS
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
   FTP_PUT_ENABLED - (optional) define this to 1 or 0 to enable/disable the
      ability for an FTP client to write to the PIC's filesystem.

   FTP_RETR_ENABLED - (optional) define this to 1 or 0 to enable/disable the
      ability for an FTP client to read from the PIC's filesystem.
      
   FTP_LIST_ENABLED - (optional) define this to 1 or 0 to enable/disable the
      ability for an FTP client to read a list of files from the PIC's 
      filesystem.
      
   FTPVerify(userString, passwdString) - (required) Return TRUE if the 
      username/password has valid authorization to use the FTP server.
   
   FTP_FORCE_DISCONNECT() - (optional) A callback provided by the user, return 
      TRUE if you want the FTP server to disconnect a connecion.
      
   FTP_MARK_ERROR() - (optiona) A callback, FTP server will call this if there
      was a problem with the filesystem during access.  This can be used to 
      log or display errors to the user.
   
   FTP_CLEAR_ERROR() - A callback, un-does a FTP_MARK_ERROR().
